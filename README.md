# afs-vagrant
A collection of AFS development containers.
* debian-dev
 * for building the linux kernel and OpenAFS packages
 * Requires ~5 GB of disk space for the initial bootstrap, ~15 GB for a kernel build
 * 1/2 of host RAM, and all CPU cores are provided to the guest
* ubuntu-builder
 * for building and testing of linux nightly kernel with OpenAFS master
* debian-server
 * for running the built packages on linux, e.g. with robotest
 * 1.4 GB of disk space, 768 MB RAM, 2 CPU cores

# Requirements
* Mac OS X
 * Admin account (group membership)
* At least 4 GB RAM, 20 GB hard disk space remaining
* Xcode or command line developer tools
* homebrew
 * Vagrant (and VirtualBox)

## Setup
### Installations
```
# Xcode or command line developer tools, some gui interaction
xcode-select --install
# Or use this if you need the command line tools: https://github.com/rtrouton/rtrouton_scripts/tree/master/rtrouton_scripts/install_xcode_command_line_tools

# homebrew & casks
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew tap caskroom/cask

# Vagrant via homebrew, may require authentication
brew cask install vagrant
```
Note: Vagrant can sometimes install a compatible version of "virtualbox virtualbox-extension-pack" automatically. If it does not, run this:
```
brew cask install virtualbox virtualbox-extension-pack
```
# Usage
One liner to bring up the afs test box called debian-server:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openafs-contrib/afs-vagrant/master/script/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- debian-server
OR
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openafs-contrib/afs-vagrant/master/script/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- debian-dev
```
Note the addition of the directory as the first argument (debian-server) to the bootstrap.sh command.

Or if you want to do it manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/openafs-contrib/afs-vagrant.git
cd afs-vagrant/debian-server
vagrant up
```
### Vagrant survival commands
```
export VAGRANT_LOG = { error | warn | info | debug }
vagrant help
vagrant halt   # shutdown
vagrant reload # halt, up
vagrant status
```
### Troubleshooting
#### Vagrant:
#### [Error: virtualbox is not installed](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7581)
"Fixed in master"
```
# using rvm 2.2.4-dev and gem install bundler
git clone https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant
cd vagrant
bundler
bundle exec vagrant help
bundle --binstubs exec
setenv PATH `pwd`/exec:$PATH
# or
export PATH=`pwd`/exec:$PATH
```
#### Homebrew fixes for originally non-admin accounts
```
# Skip this step if you are already admin
# add the user to :admin group
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a <username> -t user admin
# make sure /usr/local writable for this user
chgrp -R admin /usr/local
chmod -R g+w /usr/local
```
#### Sanity Test
```
mkdir tmp && cd tmp
vagrant init
vagrant box add bento/debian-8.4 --provider virtualbox
vagrant up
```

PRs welcome.

# Roadmap
This is intended to house the build and test environments for OpenAFS. I hope that
it might some day look similar to Chef's bento repo: https://github.com/chef/bento
though for all the kernels and OpenAFS versions we have and can mash together.
